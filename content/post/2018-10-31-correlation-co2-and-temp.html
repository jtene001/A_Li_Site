<h3>Measures of correlation and procedures for exploring correlation</h3>
<p>A measure of correlation is a numerical measure of the relationship between 2 variables (X and Y), where the measurements are taken in pairs - one measurement for each variable. By convention, such measures are crafted so that they meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lie between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>;</li>
<li>If larger values of X tend to group with larger values of Y and vice versa, the measure will be positive. If larger values of X tend to group with smaller values of Y and vice versa, the measure will be negative;</li>
<li>The stronger the tendency to group large with large and small with small, the closer the measure will be to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; and</li>
<li>The stronger the tendency to group large with small, the closer the measure will be to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our process will consist of two phases: First, we will perform an exploratory review of the data to see if possible correlation surfaces. Second, we will calculate various the various correlation measures and see if they indicate correlation.</p>

<h3>Exploratory review of the time series and their relationship</h3>
<p>Generally, we will first look to graphical representations of the data pairs to see if the two variables pair more or less in one of the ways described above (large with large or large with small). Side-by-side time series can reveal similar patterns over time. In addition, scatterplots of the data pairs can reveal the correlation relationship.</p>
<p>Our first step is to explore the data series. The first thing we can do is to look at a chart of the annual <span class="math inline">\(CO_2\)</span> data next to the annual temperature data and the monthly <span class="math inline">\(CO_2\)</span> data next to the monthly temperature data.</p>
<p>First, we look at the annual data. We can see that both of the series show a relatively steady increase over time. The carbon dioxide series is much smoother, though both are increasing in roughly similar fashion on average over time.</p>

<p>Then we can look at the two monthly series. Obviously, monthly series are more jagged than annual. We can see that the monthly carbon dioxide series reveals a seasonal fluctuation that reflects higher concentrations during northern hemisphere winters. Nevertheless, both series still reflect the same general ascending pattern.</p>
