<h3>Measures of correlation and procedures for exploring correlation</h3>
<p>A measure of correlation is a numerical measure of the relationship between 2 variables (X and Y), where the measurements are taken in pairs - one measurement for each variable. By convention, such measures are crafted so that they meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lie between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>;</li>
<li>If larger values of X tend to group with larger values of Y and vice versa, the measure will be positive. If larger values of X tend to group with smaller values of Y and vice versa, the measure will be negative;</li>
<li>The stronger the tendency to group large with large and small with small, the closer the measure will be to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; and</li>
<li>The stronger the tendency to group large with small, the closer the measure will be to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our process will consist of two phases: First, we will perform an exploratory review of the data to see if possible correlation surfaces. Second, we will calculate various the various correlation measures and see if they indicate correlation.</p>
